\title{Calculate route statistics}
\usage{
calculate_route_stats(track_points)
}
\arguments{
\item{track_points}{A data frame containing track points with the following required columns:
\itemize{
\item cumulative_distance - distance in kilometers
\item ele - elevation in meters
\item ele_gain - elevation gain in meters
\item ele_loss - elevation loss in meters
\item time - timestamps in POSIXct format (optional, for time-based calculations)
}}
}
\value{
A list containing the following route statistics:
\itemize{
\item total_distance_km - total distance in kilometers
\item total_elevation_gain_m - cumulative elevation gain in meters
\item total_elevation_loss_m - cumulative elevation loss in meters
\item max_elevation_m - maximum elevation in meters
\item min_elevation_m - minimum elevation in meters
\item total_time_hours - total activity time in hours (if time data available)
\item avg_speed - average speed in km/h (if time data available)
}
}
\description{
Calculates basic statistics from GPS track data, including distance, elevation, and time metrics.
}
\details{
This function processes track point data to extract key statistics about a GPS route.
Time-based statistics are only calculated if the input data contains valid timestamps.
All numeric values are rounded to 2 decimal places for readability.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# First read a GPX file
track_data <- read_gpx_track("path/to/activity.gpx")

# Calculate distance and elevation changes
track_data <- calculate_distance(track_data)

# Calculate route statistics
stats <- calculate_route_stats(track_data)

# Print the statistics
print(stats)
}
