\title{Calculate elevation statistics from GPS track points}
\usage{
calculate_elevation_stats(track_points)
}
\arguments{
\item{track_points}{A data frame containing track points with at least the following column:
\itemize{
\item ele - elevation in meters
}}
}
\value{
The input data frame with the following additional columns:
\itemize{
\item ele_gain - elevation gain in meters (0 for flat or downhill segments)
\item ele_loss - elevation loss in meters (0 for flat or uphill segments)
\item cumulative_ele_gain - cumulative elevation gain in meters
\item cumulative_ele_loss - cumulative elevation loss in meters
}
}
\description{
Calculates elevation gain and loss between consecutive GPS track points and
adds these metrics to the track points data frame.
}
\details{
This function calculates the elevation difference between consecutive points.
Positive changes are recorded as elevation gain, while negative changes are recorded as elevation loss.
The function also calculates cumulative metrics to track total elevation change over the entire route.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# First read a GPX file
track_data <- read_gpx_track("path/to/activity.gpx")

# Calculate elevation statistics
track_data <- calculate_elevation_stats(track_data)

# View the elevation data
head(track_data[, c("ele", "ele_gain", "ele_loss", "cumulative_ele_gain")])
}
