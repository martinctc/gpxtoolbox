\title{Calculate distances between GPS track points}
\usage{
calculate_distance(track_points)
}
\arguments{
\item{track_points}{A data frame containing track points with at least the following columns:
\itemize{
\item lon - longitude in decimal degrees
\item lat - latitude in decimal degrees
}}
}
\value{
The input data frame with the following additional columns:
\itemize{
\item distance - distance to previous point in meters (0 for the first point)
\item cumulative_distance - cumulative distance traveled in kilometers
}
}
\description{
Calculates the distance between consecutive GPS track points and adds both individual segment
distances and cumulative distance to the track points data frame.
}
\details{
This function uses the Haversine formula to calculate the great-circle distance between
consecutive GPS points, accounting for the curvature of the Earth. The first point has
a distance of 0, and each subsequent point's distance is measured from the previous point.

\dontrun{
# First read a GPX file
track_data <- read_gpx_track("path/to/activity.gpx")

# Calculate distances
track_data <- calculate_distance(track_data)

# View the distance data
head(track_data[, c("lon", "lat", "distance", "cumulative_distance")])
